  intro:
    "Recently, cloud data center (CDC) failures are commonplace. To prevent users' data from being inaccessible due to CDC failures, we design a JointCloud disaster tolerance system (JCDT). JCDT encodes data to several coded blocks with erasure code and distributes these coded blocks to cloud hosts of multiple CDCs. When some of these CDCs fail, users' original data can be retrieved by coded blocks stored in available CDCs. JCDT designs a data writing method, a data read method, and a data repair method for JointCloud erasure codes to achieve high disaster tolerance, low redundancy, and high efficiency.",

  <p>The existing erasure-coded storage systems are mainly designed for a single cloud data center (CDC) environment. In a cross-CDC, they need to transfer a large amount of data across CDCs (via the public network) to write, read, and repair data. Since the bandwidth of the public network is much lower than the bandwidth of the internal network, their speed of writing, reading, and repairing data is low. This JCDT system includes a data writing method, a data read method, and a data repair method designed for cross-CDC erasure codes, which can improve the speed of data writing, data read, and data repair by minimizing the cross-CDC traffic.
  </p>
  <h4>1. Data writing method of cross-CDC erasure codes</h4>
  <p>This method selects encoding nodes by comparing the number of coded blocks in the receiving end CDC and the sending end CDC so that the cross-CDC traffic is always equal to the minimum number of coded blocks in the receiving end CDC and the sending end CDC. Hence it can effectively reduce the cross-CDC traffic of data writing, thereby increasing the writing speed. In addition, because this method organizes the data writing process into a two-stage pipeline (the first stage: the client writes the data blocks; the second stage: the storage nodes coordinate to complete the encoding of parity blocks), it can further improve the writing speed of batched data.
  </p>
  <h4>2. Data read method of cross-CDC erasure codes</h4>
  <p>This method retrieves the original data by reading and decoding several coded blocks closest to the client. This reading method achieves the purpose of reducing the cross-CDC traffic at the cost of increasing computing overhead. Since the transmission time of cross-CDC erasure codes is much longer than the computing time, this method can increase the read speed.
  </p>
  <h4>3. Single cloud host repair method of cross-CDC erasure codes</h4>
  <p>This method uses a tree-star hybrid topology to organize data transmission and data merging when repairing a single cloud host: first, it uses the star transmission topology to merge the auxiliary blocks in each CDC. Then, it builds a minimum network distance spanning tree to organize the transmission of auxiliary blocks merged in each CDC. This method makes the number of blocks transferred across CDC to repair each block in the failed cloud host is not greater than the number of CDCs minus one, so the repair speed can be effectively improved.
  </p>
  <h4>4. Single CDC repair method for cross-CDC erasure codes</h4>
  <p>This method selects the node that merges the auxiliary blocks by comparing the number of blocks to be repaired in the receiving end CDC and the number of auxiliary blocks in the sending end CDC so that the cross-CDC traffic is always equal to the minimum value of the number of blocks to be repaired in the receiving end CDC and the number of auxiliary blocks in the sending end CDC. Therefore, it can effectively reduce the cross-CDC traffic of repairing a CDC, thereby increasing the repair speed of the CDC.
